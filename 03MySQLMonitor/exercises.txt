1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

clients connect to the server to perform database operations such as reading or storing data.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (We’ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

mysql> help SELECT
  Name: 'SELECT'
	Description:
	Syntax:
	SELECT
 	   [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
 	     [HIGH_PRIORITY]
 	     [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
 	     [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
 	     [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
 	   select_expr [, select_expr ...]
 	   [FROM table_references
  	  [WHERE where_condition]
  	  [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
  	    [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
 	   [HAVING where_condition]
 	   [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
 	     [ASC | DESC], ...]
 	   [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
 	   [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
 	   [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
 	       [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
 	       export_options
	      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
 	     | INTO var_name [, var_name]]
 	   [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

	SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
	can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
	http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/subqueries.html.

	The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

	o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
	  must be at least one select_expr.

	o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
	  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

	o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
	  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
	  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
 	 statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

 	 In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
	  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary)
	  functions. See
	  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/expressions.html, and
 	 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/functions.html.

	SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
	any table.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

    In interactive mode, you type in SQL queries or MySQL commands such as SHOW DATABASES 
at the MySQL prompt, and view the results. 
    In batch mode, you tell the monitor to read in and execute a list of commands from a file.
This is useful when you need to run a large set of operations— for example, when you want to 
restore a database from a backup file.

 

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?
user - the username to use when connecting to the MySQL user.
By Default this is the machine account name on a Mac OS System
  password - password for the user
	database - specifies the database to use. Saves one from having to specify this with the USE command after the monitor starts.
